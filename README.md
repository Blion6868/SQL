<h1>MOTIVATION</h1>

<h2>This portfolio showcases my data analytics skills, including feature engineering, data visualization, SQL, and machine learning. These projects demonstrate how I can contribute to better business decisions.</h2>

<h1>CODE STYLE</h1>

<h2>These projects were built in Python, using Jupyter notebooks for data exploration. While Jupyter notebooks are not often used in production, it allows for a more streamlined and readable code. The various libraries used are as follows: TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Numpy. The SQL_Queries file showcases queries made using PGAdmin/PostgreSQL.</h2>
